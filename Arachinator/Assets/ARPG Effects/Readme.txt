1. INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------

To use the effects, simply find a way to instantiate them, or drag & drop them into the scene.

The effects will automatically start playing when the scene is running.

----------------------------------------
2. SCALING EFFECTS
----------------------------------------

To scale an effect in the scene, simply use the default Scaling tool (Hotkey 'R'). You can also select the effect and type in the Scale in Transform manually.

----------------------------------------
3. MODULAR EFFECTS
----------------------------------------

Certain effects have Modular/White versions that don't rely on pre-colored textures. You can easily recolor these effects by changing the Start Color in the prefabs. Pre-colored effects may have a bit more refined color palette to them, but requires more texture space if you plan to use several of them. For mobile projects I recommend using the modular versions as they are more flexible and require less texture space.

4. URP Upgrade
----------------------------------------

To upgrade to URP find the ARPG Effects/Upgrade' folder, double-click the Upgrade package and import to your project.

----------------------------------------
5. Custom Scripts and Packages
----------------------------------------

ARPG Effects uses only a few custom scripts for the effects which are optional.

ARPGFXLightFade - This script will simply fade out lights after a set amount of time, and works well for explosion effects.
ARPGFXLightFlicker - This will make light sources flicker or fade in and out multiple times.
ARPGFXPortalScript - This is a small demo of how the portal effects are meant to work. It will loop the chosen portal effect to open and close.
ARPGFXRotation - Simple script for rotating effects and lights

If you get errors in the demo scenes, they should mostly be harmless and referring to Post Processing and ProBuilder if you do not have those packages installed.
